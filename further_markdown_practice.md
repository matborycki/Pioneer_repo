## Further Markdown practice

In this document, I'm trying out some more complexed syntax than in the ***[My first Markdown file](https://github.com/matborycki/Pioneer_repo/blob/90f9253a2578ff8578ea46a5c89d465051ffa591/My_first_markdown_file.md "Check it out!")***.

### Maybe want to see a beautiful view?

There you go. It is in Tatra Mountains, which are one of my most beloved mountains in Poland.

### A sample table with prices

| Item   | Value   |
|:------:  |:-------:  |
|Apple   | $0.20|
|Bread   | $1.50|
|Beer 6 pack|$10.00|


### Sample JavaScript code

```javaScript
let person = {
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 25,
    country: "Ireland",
}

function logData(){
    let message = person.name + " is " + person.age + " year ols and lives in " + person.country
    console.log(message)
}

logData()
```

** Output in the console should be like that: **
> John Doe is 25 years old and lives in Ireland
