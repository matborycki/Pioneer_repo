# My first site in markdown

### _Trying out some markdown features_

- __[Check sport events](https://sport.onet.pl/ "Sport by onet")__
- __[Check the weather](https://www.accuweather.com/)__
- **[Look for some great recipes](https://aniagotuje.pl/ "Great recipes by the polish cookmaster")**

A solid knowledge of ***Markdown*** is a key asset for every technical writer.  
As **writing** itself.  

Another feature of Markdown are blockquotes like below:

> Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle.
>> The Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.
>>> **Eviva l\`arte!**
