# Pioneer_repo - why I do this?
This is my first repository in Github hence the name **Pioneer**. I've never done anything in Github before, but I am willing to learn and discover new opportunities to develop my skills. 

This repository contains some _Markdown_ and _JavaScript files_, which I create while learning these languages. This repository is a "safe and sound" place for my files.


### JavaScript guide
***

I learn JavaScript from the Scrimba's guide, which you can find *[here](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript)
<br>

### Markdown guide
***

I learn _Markdown_ using several guides, but ones I can recommend are:

- **[Markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/)** - really well-written and comprehensive guide on how to use Markdown.
- **[Markdowntutorial.com](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)** - short, but sweet and really easy introduction to Markdown, which you can complete in 15 minutes.
