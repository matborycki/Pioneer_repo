# Pioneer_repo - why I do this?
This is my first repository in Github hence the name **Pioneer**. I've never done anything in Github before, but I am willing to learn and discover new opportunities to develop my skills. 

This repository contains some _Markdown_ and _JavaScript files_, which I create while learning these languages. This repository is a _safe and sound_ place for my files.


### JavaScript guide

I learn JavaScript from the _[Scrimba's guide]((https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript "I like it, so check that out!")_, which is a quick, fast-pased introduction to JavaScript with a very friendly narration.

### Markdown guide

I learn _Markdown_ using several guides, but ones I can recommend are:

- **[Markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/)** - really well-written and comprehensive guide on how to use Markdown.
- **[Markdowntutorial.com](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)** - short, but sweet and really easy introduction to Markdown, which you can complete in 15 minutes.
